# Title
Comment-On-Your-Occupation - COYO

# Objective
Many students are facing difficulties in figuring out what they wanna do in the future but there aren't many places where you can get some ideas from. so I decided to make a website that helps them out through the website. so they wouldn't waste of the time to figure it out what it's like to be and they'd make a better decision when they decide the university course.

# Pages
