# Title
Comment-On-Your-Occupation - COYO

# Objective
Many students in the world are facing difficulties in figuring out what occupation they want to have in the future but there aren't many places where you can get some ideas from. so I made a decision to make a website that helps them out through the comments from people who actually have the occupation. so they wouldn't be wasting of the time to figure it out what it's like to be. they would make a better decision when they're deciding the university course as well.
